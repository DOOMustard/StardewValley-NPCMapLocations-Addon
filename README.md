# StardewValley-NPCMapLocations-Addon
This Addon is made obsolete by the most recent update to NPCMapLocations
This update allows cross-mod communication to generate all the functionality that this addon was supposed to provide.

As I am not the creator of the respective mods I won't be able to help create that cross-mod comunication without being asked to by the respective mod creators.
If you are a creator who wants help I'd be happy to help, feel free to ask (raising an issue or sending me an email), 
feel free to copy without asking
      the numbers I used for the custom npc marker offsets are found in globals.json
      the map locaion points (customlocations.json) (which have been slightly offset if I got them from another source to allow for more compatibility with other mods)

there are some formating changes between the cross-mod communication and the new changes.
the tooltips were all collected straight from the respective mod's pages so I figure you already have them
